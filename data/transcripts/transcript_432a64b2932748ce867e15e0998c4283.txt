<Person1> <prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium" volume="medium">Welcome to TECH INTERVIEW SIMULATION  - 당신의 기술적 여정을 들려주세요. Today, we're diving deep into the experience and potential of a front-end developer with a focus on practical experience and growth possibilities.</prosody></Person1>

<Person2> <prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium" volume="medium">Excited to be here.  I'm eager to discuss my experience in front-end development, specifically with TypeScript, React, and Vue.js.</prosody></Person2>

<Person1> <prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium" volume="medium">Excellent! Your resume highlights experience with a large-scale game service's anti-cheat system and AI-based web games. Tell me more about your approach to robust system design using modularization and test automation. Um, specifically, how do you ensure maintainability and scalability in your projects?</prosody></Person1>

<Person2> <prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium" volume="medium">Well, I believe in data-driven decisions.  In my experience with the anti-cheat system, I saw firsthand the issues caused by inaccurate post-facto bans, including player frustration and delayed action.  <emphasis>My approach focuses on preemptive measures</emphasis>. By leveraging data mining to model user behavior, specifically character creation and login patterns, we were able to identify and restrict illicit activity much earlier.  This was a critical aspect of the project's success.</prosody></Person2>

<Person1> <prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium" volume="medium">I see. Interesting. So, you used data mining to predict and prevent rather than react.  Can you elaborate on the technical implementation? What technologies did you utilize and how did they contribute to the system's effectiveness?</prosody></Person1>

<Person2> <prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium" volume="medium">Certainly.  We used <say-as interpret-as="characters">TypeScript</say-as>, <say-as interpret-as="characters">React</say-as>, <say-as interpret-as="characters">Vue.js</say-as>, <say-as interpret-as="characters">Redis</say-as>, <say-as interpret-as="characters">MySQL</say-as>, and <say-as interpret-as="characters">Elasticsearch</say-as> for the core system.  <say-as interpret-as="characters">AWS</say-as> services like <say-as interpret-as="characters">EKS</say-as> and <say-as interpret-as="characters">S3</say-as>, along with <say-as interpret-as="characters">Terraform</say-as>, <say-as interpret-as="characters">Kubernetes</say-as>, <say-as interpret-as="characters">GitLab CI/CD</say-as>, <say-as interpret-as="characters">ArgoCD</say-as>, <say-as interpret-as="characters">Sentry</say-as>, <say-as interpret-as="characters">Grafana</say-as>, and <say-as interpret-as="characters">Playwright</say-as> enabled us to build a robust and scalable infrastructure.  The use of <say-as interpret-as="characters">i18n</say-as> also allowed us to support multiple languages. I also worked on optimizing the API, significantly reducing log retrieval time from one minute to two seconds by separating read-only and historical data into <say-as interpret-as="characters">Redis</say-as> and <say-as interpret-as="characters">MySQL</say-as>, respectively.  Later, we migrated from <say-as interpret-as="characters">MySQL</say-as> to <say-as interpret-as="characters">Elasticsearch</say-as> and archived older data to <say-as interpret-as="characters">S3</say-as> using cron jobs, optimizing database size and improving data analysis for our data engineers.</prosody></Person2>

<Person1> <prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium" volume="medium">Got it. It sounds like you have a strong understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies.  You mentioned a front-end console for managing illicit activity.  What was your role in its development, and what were the key features you implemented?</prosody></Person1>

<Person2> <prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium" volume="medium">I led the front-end development of that console.  The goal was to empower analysts and game managers with a user-friendly interface to monitor and manage illicit activity directly, thereby reducing management overhead. Integrating <say-as interpret-as="characters">Playwright</say-as> for end-to-end testing and <say-as interpret-as="characters">Sentry</say-as> for error tracking significantly improved the stability of our development process, especially compared to the previous quarterly testing cycle.</prosody></Person2>

<Person1> <prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium" volume="medium">Impressive.  Integrating 33 games like MapleStory, Dungeon Fighter Online, and FIFA must have presented unique challenges.  How did you address the complexities of integrating with diverse game systems?</prosody></Person1>

<Person2> <prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium" volume="medium">Each game had its own API and data structure.  The key was establishing clear communication channels with each game's development team and creating a flexible, adaptable integration framework.  This allowed us to handle the nuances of each game’s data while maintaining a unified system for detection and prevention.</prosody></Person2>

<Person1><prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium" volume="medium">That's a great example of practical problem-solving.  Your focus on preemptive measures and data-driven decisions clearly paid off with the reported 700 million won reduction in illicit gains per quarter.  Any final thoughts you’d like to share?</prosody></Person1>

<Person2><prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium" volume="medium"> I'm passionate about leveraging technology to create positive impact. This project demonstrated how data-driven solutions can address real-world challenges.  I am always eager to learn and contribute to innovative projects. </prosody></Person2>

<Person1> <prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium" volume="medium">Thank you for sharing your insights and experiences with us today.  It was a pleasure learning about your work and your passion for technology.  We appreciate your time and wish you all the best in your future endeavors.  And to our listeners, thank you for joining us for another episode of TECH INTERVIEW SIMULATION.  Until next time, goodbye!</prosody></Person1>
